How to check the frame rate:
If the user has a frame rate of 60 then he will be able to see both frames of the 60fps video switching but will not be
able to see the frames of the 120fps video switching because his screen will update once while 2 frames will pass.

by asking the question: Which video is falshing in the most regular way ? (stable pattern of switching between white circle and black background)
If the user choose the 60fps video then his screen could not show him the frames switching in real time for the 120fps video and then it is safe to assume
that his frame rate is below 120 fps.

The same could be used for any 2 frame rates:
if the user is watching a regular flashing with the frame rate X but non regular flashing for the frame rate Y. Then is is safe to assume that the user has has lower frame rate than Y.
